# ðŸš€ 5 New Technologies Every Local Business Should Know

### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Automation

> AI-powered chatbots and predictive analytics are making waves in sectors like retail, hospitality, and agriculture. They help local businesses streamline operations, provide instant support, and make smarter decisions using customer data. For example, chatbots can handle routine queries, freeing up staff and improving customer satisfaction

### 2. Internet of Things (IoT) & 5G Connectivity

With 5G expanding, Cambodia is primed for an IoT revolution. Local manufacturers and food processors are starting to use sensors and connected devices to monitor production, enable smart inventory control, and reduce downtime by predicting machine failures before they happen.

### 3. Blockchain for Payments & Traceability

Beyond payments, blockchain helps build trust in sectors like agriculture and logistics through enhanced traceability across the supply chain. 

### 4. Fintech & Alternative Credit Scoring

Cambodia's rising fintech ecosystem is offering SMEs more options than ever. Cashless payments via apps like ABA Pay, Wing, Pi Pay, and PiPay QR have surged. Meanwhile, new alternative data modelsâ€”including mobile wallet histories and digital footprintsâ€”are enabling lenders to offer loans to previously underserved businesses without relying on collateral or traditional bank history.

### 5. Cloud Computing & SaaS Solutions
